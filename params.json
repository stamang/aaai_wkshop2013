In the semi-parametric clustering framework, Markovian models provide useful parametric assumptions for modeling temporal dynamics, and a non-parametric method is used to cluster the temporal abstractions instead of operating on the original data.   Our contribution extends abstraction to continuous-time Markov models and the clustering component to the non-parametric Bayesian setting, which does not require the number of clusters to be indicated a priori.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
